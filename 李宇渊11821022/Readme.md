[FNText: A Fast Neural Model for Efficient Text Classification](Fntext.pdf)  
* **Abstract**
>In recent years,very deep neural models based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable results in natural language processing (NLP). However, the computational complexity also largely increasesas the networks go deeper, which causes long training time. To raise the efﬁciency of calculation, this paper focus on shallow neural model and explores a fast neural text classiﬁcation model FNText, which only contains 3 layers,without activation function and stacked time-consuming convolutional layers. Instead of enumerating a bag of bi-grams, we propose a novel method which utilizes average pooling operation along randomly initializing word vectors to obtain bi-gram features. These additional bi-gramfeatures can further improve the performance of FNText. We improve the training speed by ignoring hyperparameters with zero-gradients. Experiments show that FNText can be trained on more than 300 million words in less than 10 minutes using a standard multicore CPU, and achieves competitive results on several large-scale datasets. Sometimes FNText is on par with very deep neural models.
